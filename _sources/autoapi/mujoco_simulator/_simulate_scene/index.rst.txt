.. py:function:: simulate_scene(scene_id: int, scene: revolve2.simulation.scene.Scene, headless: bool, record_settings: revolve2.simulation.simulator.RecordSettings | None, start_paused: bool, control_step: float, sample_step: float | None, simulation_time: int | None, simulation_timestep: float, cast_shadows: bool, fast_sim: bool) -> list[revolve2.simulation.scene.SimulationState]

   Simulate a scene.

   :param scene_id: An id for this scene, unique between all scenes ran in parallel.
   :param scene: The scene to simulate.
   :param headless: If False, a viewer will be opened that allows a user to manually view and manually interact with the simulation.
   :param record_settings: If not None, recording will be done according to these settings.
   :param start_paused: If true, the simulation will start in a paused state. Only makessense when headless is False.
   :param control_step: The time between each call to the handle function of the scene handler. In seconds.
   :param sample_step: The time between each state sample of the simulation. In seconds.
   :param simulation_time: How long to simulate for. In seconds.
   :param simulation_timestep: The duration to integrate over during each step of the simulation. In seconds.
   :param cast_shadows: If shadows are cast.
   :param fast_sim: If fancy rendering is disabled.
   :returns: The results of simulation. The number of returned states depends on `sample_step`.
