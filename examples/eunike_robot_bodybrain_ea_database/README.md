This is the folder for the bachelor thesis' code. It is a copy of `robot_bodybrain_ea_databse` but with edited to fit the purpose of the thesis. 
`main.py` allows the terrains and terrains sequence to be change along with the number of generations and run per terrain.

Definitely first look at the `robot_bodybrain_ea` and `simple_ea_xor_database` examples.
Many explanation comments are omitted here.

To visualize the evolved robots, use `rerun.py` or `rerun_indiv.py` with the pickled genotype you got from evolution and the genotype_id to see a specific individual.
Running `plot.py` allows you to plot the robots fitness metrics over each generation.
